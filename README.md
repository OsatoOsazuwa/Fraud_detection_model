# Fraud Detection System with Streamlit

This project is a fraud detection system built with a deep learning model using TensorFlow, deployed with Streamlit for an interactive web interface. It allows users to input transaction details manually or upload a CSV file for fraud prediction.

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using a deep learning model and various transaction features. Users can either input transaction details manually or upload a CSV file containing transaction data for the fraud detection system to evaluate.  Data used- [IEEE-Fraud-detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/data)

## Features
- **Manual Input**: Enter transaction details manually and get an immediate fraud prediction.
- **CSV Upload**: Upload a CSV file to analyze multiple transactions at once.
- **Prediction Results**: The system predicts whether the transaction is fraudulent or legitimate, displaying the probability.
- **Model**: The system uses an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a classifier to predict fraud.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow**: Used for building and training the deep learning model.
- **Streamlit**: Used to create the interactive web app.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for data preprocessing, including scaling and encoding.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and CSV file handling.
- **Imbalanced-learn**: Used for handling class imbalance with SMOTE.
- **Joblib**: Used for saving and loading models.
